# Battleships

Battleship game which made use of proir lessons around test driven development.

Project was a steep learning curve and certain features were challenging to implement such as the drag and drop feature for the ships.

**Potential features that I could add in the future**
* Randomising the location of each players fleet
* Being able to add the ships horizontally as well as vertically
